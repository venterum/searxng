# SearXNG by Venterum

This is a custom build of [SearXNG](https://github.com/searxng/searxng), a privacy-respecting metasearch engine.
Based on the fork by [privau/searxng](https://github.com/privau/searxng), this version includes additional visual improvements to the search input and other UI elements.

It also retains the custom theme support from the privau build, including themes from Catppuccin, Paulgoio, Kagi, Brave, Moa, and the official SearXNG themes.
